-> ITEM MENU - a separate list which contains pokemart items along with their prices for adding to inventory.
- contains parent ol (item categories -> healing, pokeballs, etc) and child ul's for listing actual items with their prices

2) CSS:
- 1st flexbox which contains title + desc
- 2nd flexbox which contains actual form operations
- 3rd flexbox for item menu, with separate child div's for item categories



3) JS:

c) corner cases for the inventory bill
d) appending item name, price and images to the newly created inventory list
